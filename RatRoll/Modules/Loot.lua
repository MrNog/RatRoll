-- RatRoll -- Loot (native core module).
--
-- Implements the plan in docs/LOOT_PLAN.md, combining:
--   * DROP capture, RaidRoll-style  (docs/RAIDROLL_HOW_IT_WORKS.md)
--   * WHO-RECEIVED attribution, MRT-style via CHAT_MSG_LOOT  (docs/MRT_LOOT_MODEL.md)
--   * MS/OS rolls + confirm-before-award + GiveMasterLoot
--
-- Goal: a persistent HISTORY per session/boss (item + who got it + roll + boss +
-- date), exportable to the RATS web hub.
--
-- Triggers (by context -- GetInstanceInfo instance_type):
--   RAID    -> broadcast via RatRoll.Comms: whoever detects loot tells the others.
--   DUNGEON -> START_LOOT_ROLL (native need/greed, fires on every client).
--   (LOOT_OPENED also feeds capture when WE open the corpse -- reinforcement.)
--
-- Boss: 3.3.5a has NO native ENCOUNTER_START/END, so we ported MRT's boss SCANNER
-- (Compat335) -- recognises a boss by classification/level/HP (no hardcoded list)
-- and its death from the COMBAT_LOG. Bosses are PAGES within one run/session
-- (DropsByBoss), navigated with the <> pager -- never a session per boss.

-- by scanning units and recognising "boss-like" -- we ported that logic so
-- RatRoll is autonomous (no MRT needed) and just as robust.
--
-- Idea: an NPC is "boss-like" if classification worldboss, level -1/999
-- (skull), or very high maxHp -- no hardcoded list needed. On engaging
-- a boss we keep its name (currentBoss) to LABEL the loot -- which becomes a
-- PAGE (per boss) within the session/run, NOT a new session.

-- Boss context PERSISTED across a /reload. Everything above is a module-scope local,
-- so a /reload (which re-runs this file) wiped it: `encounterBoss` went back to nil and
-- resolveBoss() answered "Trash" even though a boss died seconds ago. A RL announcing the
-- loot right after that reload then filed a whole boss drop under a fresh "Trash" page.
--
-- So we mirror the confirmed boss into the per-character DB keyed by the RUN (runKey),
-- with a WALL-CLOCK stamp (time(), not GetTime(): GetTime is uptime and resets to 0 on
-- every login/reload, so it can't measure "how long ago" across the reload). On load we
-- read it back ONLY if it belongs to the run we are in and is still within the label TTL.

-- same corpse. The comms + chat paths leave it false so an echoed broadcast of the same
-- physical drop still collapses instead of showing the item twice.
-- The ITEM overrules the SCANNER. resolveBoss() infers a name from targets, corpses and
-- a remembered kill; every one of those can be stale or plain wrong on an encounter the
-- scanner cannot vet. A raid item, though, drops from exactly one boss -- so when the id
-- is in RatRollItemBoss (Modules/ItemBoss-Data.lua, gear only, single-boss ids only) that
-- name IS the answer.
--
-- Only ever CORRECTS a name to the item's true boss; it never invents one for an item we
-- don't know (tokens, gems, BoEs, patterns keep the scanner's guess) and never touches a
-- drop already sitting on the right page.
-- BoE is the exception: a Bind-on-Equip piece sits in a boss's table but ALSO drops from
-- trash anywhere in the instance, so its id does not identify an encounter. Correcting one
-- invents a kill -- a trash BoE was relabelled "Rotface" on a night that stopped at
-- Saurfang. BoEs keep whatever the scanner said (usually the honest "Trash").
-- The one BoE answer that IS exact: an item the table lists as "Trash" drops from trash
-- and nothing else (the ICC trash BoEs, the Ulduar trash pieces), so it goes on the
-- Trash page whatever boss was fought last.
-- SHARED TOKENS. The ICC Marks of Sanctification drop from five bosses, so the
-- item->boss table cannot name one -- but it can rule the rest out. A Mark filed under
-- any other boss is a stale label, and the boss whose death the combat log saw last

-- PENDING AWARD -- why GiveMasterLoot's return value is not enough.
--
-- RaidRoll calls GiveMasterLoot and assumes it worked; it can afford to, because it
-- never records WHO received an item. We do. On 3.3.5a no API reports whether the
-- server accepted the hand-over (the master-loot candidate list is server-side and
-- can be stale), so trusting the call meant the UI showed "X was awarded [item]" for
-- an item X never got -- and the history kept that lie.
--
-- So an award is a PENDING request until something observable confirms it:
--   * LOOT_SLOT_CLEARED on the slot we gave  -> delivered (primary; always fires on
--     the ML's own client, unlike CHAT_MSG_LOOT which is not sent for loot handed to
--     someone else).
--   * CHAT_MSG_LOOT naming the winner        -> delivered (backup; tagReceiver).
--   * neither within AWARD_TIMEOUT           -> NOT delivered: drop goes back to
--     unassigned and we tell the user to trade it.
--   * LOOT_CLOSED                            -> INVALIDATES (walking away from the
--     corpse clears every slot; treating that as success is the very bug we fix).
