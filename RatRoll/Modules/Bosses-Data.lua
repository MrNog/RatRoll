if RATROLL_OFF then return end -- generated from Okanvil/Modules/Bosses-Data.lua, edit there.  ============================================================
--  RatRoll-Bosses-Data -- shared boss creatureID table.
--
--  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--  Both Loot.lua (to label a drop with the boss that dropped it) and Logs.lua (to
--  log a kill) need to answer "is this NPC a boss?". Logs.lua had its own `local
--  BOSS_IDS`, invisible to Loot.lua -- `local` scopes a name to ONE file. Worse,
--  Loot.lua loads BEFORE Logs.lua, so even a global would not have been set yet.
--  Hence a data file, loaded first, exposing plain globals -- the same pattern
--  IDs-Data.lua uses for RatRollIDs_Seed.
--
--  Without a list, boss detection falls back to an HP heuristic (isBossLike): in a
--  dungeon, "elite with >80k HP". That guess promotes beefy trash (a Drakkari Rhino)
--  and would miss a low-HP boss. An id is exact and locale-proof.
--
--  SOURCES, no id invented:
--    * WA/BossHP/BossHP.lua -- all WotLK raids AND 5-man dungeons.
--    * DBM-Icecrown's SetCreatureID lines -- the authority for ICC. DBM's ICC
--      mods are tuned against live Warmane logs, and they are what every raid
--      already relies on to start its timers.
--
--  FORMAT: [creatureID] = "Boss Name"   (matching is by id; the name is the label)
